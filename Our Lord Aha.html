		<h2> Aha, our wonderful aeon </h2>
			We, fools, follow Aha The Elation, but we call him The Laughter. <br />

			If I quote the super popstar of the Epsilon XII system, Ast Rickley: <br />
			<div class="quote">
				Aha will never give you up, never let you down, or run around and desert you. THEY will never make you cry, say goodbye, or tell a lie and hurt you. <br />
			</div>
			Here's a few reasons why you should follow Aha and join us:
			<ol>
				<li>To have fun!</li>
				<li>To bring fun and chaos to this world!</li>
				<li>Why not? You're reading the reasons, so stop reading and join!!!</li>
