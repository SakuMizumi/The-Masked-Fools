		Oh, him... Unlike the others, he always has a limit he doesn't dare to cross... But there's no fun in that! However, he does handle things well whenever money is included.<br />
		You might have met him in Jarilo VI, more exactly in Belobog. <br />
		He barely did anything worth of the fools, but here's a list of what he did...
		<ul>
			<li> During Jarilo VI's arc, he may or may not have helped you (and I don't care) </li>
			<li> Why are you still here? Go read something else! </li>
			<li> I'm too lazy to write more in this page... </li>
		</ul>
