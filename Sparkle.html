		Oh you want to know more about me? Well I am Sparkle. You can see a portrait of myself on the right of the screen.<br />
		Here's a list of what I have done so far:
		<ul>
			<li> In 2.0, I was introduced in Honkai: Star Rail as a five star character. </li>
			<li> In the whole Penacony arc, I helped the Stellaron Hunters to ensure Firefly's (or SAM) safety through her three "deaths". And I helped Aventurine and your train buddies to uncover the conspiracy within The Family. </li>
			<li> In 2.3, on the Radiant Feldspar, I hosted a game: I placed 1000 dolls all over the ship (one of them is a "bomb"). The "bomb" left a magnificent firework show! It was so much fun to see everyone panicking! I had a good laugh...</li>
			<li> In Honkai Impact 3rd, version 7.8, I entered the quantum computer that is Mars, and I met Vita. I encouraged her to join us.

			</li>
			<li> In 7.9, I'll finally be playable in Honkai Impact 3rd! Come see me! I brought some surprises as well...</li>
		</ul>
